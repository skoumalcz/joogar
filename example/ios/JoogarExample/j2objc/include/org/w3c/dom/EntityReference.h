/*!
 @brief <code>EntityReference</code> nodes may be used to represent an entity
 reference in the tree.
 Note that character references and references to
 predefined entities are considered to be expanded by the HTML or XML
 processor so that characters are represented by their Unicode equivalent
 rather than by an entity reference. Moreover, the XML processor may
 completely expand references to entities while building the
 <code>Document</code>, instead of providing <code>EntityReference</code>
 nodes. If it does provide such nodes, then for an
 <code>EntityReference</code> node that represents a reference to a known
 entity an <code>Entity</code> exists, and the subtree of the
 <code>EntityReference</code> node is a copy of the <code>Entity</code>
 node subtree. However, the latter may not be true when an entity contains
 an unbound namespace prefix. In such a case, because the namespace prefix
 resolution depends on where the entity reference is, the descendants of
 the <code>EntityReference</code> node may be bound to different namespace
 URIs. When an <code>EntityReference</code> node represents a reference to
 an unknown entity, the node has no children and its replacement value,
 when used by <code>Attr.value</code> for example, is empty.
 <p>As for <code>Entity</code> nodes, <code>EntityReference</code> nodes and
 all their descendants are readonly.
 <p ><b>Note:</b> <code>EntityReference</code> nodes may cause element
 content and attribute value normalization problems when, such as in XML
 1.0 and XML Schema, the normalization is performed after entity reference
 are expanded.
